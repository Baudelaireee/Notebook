\section{Interpolation Method}

Now we will solve the equation by using p-adic interpolation method. Firstly, we notice that \(\sqrt[3]{2} \notin \qq_3\) by observing that \(n^3 = 2 \mod 9\) has no solution, so we still consider the finite extension by adjoining \(\theta = \sqrt[3]{2}\) to construct, then we have the similar result.

\begin{proposition}
    In \(\qq_3 (\theta)\) we have

    - The absolute value of the field is
    \[|a+b\theta+c\theta^2| = \sqrt[3]{|a^3+2b^3+4c^3-6abc|_3}\]

    - \(v=-1+\theta\) is a fundamental unit and \(v^3 = 1+3\theta-3\theta^2\).

    - 
\end{proposition}
