\section{Interpolation Method}

Now we will solve the equation by using p-adic interpolation method. Firstly, we notice that \(\sqrt[3]{2} \notin \qq_3\) by observing that \(n^3 = 2 \mod 9\) has no solution, so we still consider the finite extension by adjoining \(\theta = \sqrt[3]{2}\) to construct, then we have the similar result.

\begin{proposition}
    In \(\qq_3 (\theta)\) we have

    - This field is a complete non-archimdean field with the absolute value:
    \[|a+b\theta+c\theta^2| = \sqrt[3]{|a^3+2b^3+4c^3-6abc|_3}\]
    
\end{proposition}
