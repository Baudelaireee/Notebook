\section{Number System}
Without talking some basic knowledge of Mathmatics logic, we generally define the object we want to study: Number System is a set of "number" and equipped by certain opreations. Here "number" is not necessary a real number like 1,2,3 we face daily in caculation, later we will aware that "number is actually a represent of a system, or using the language of the category, a normal system like \(\n\) is just a represent object we choose in a category \(Cat(\n)\) (The collection of the system same as \(\n\)).

The main goal of this part is to construct the different number system begin from the natural number \(\n\), the procedure often can be found in the textbook and the exercise, and the extension of distinct system inspire us to define the new algebra object.
