\subsubsection{arithmetic of polynoimal}
In this section we will discuss the arithemtic properties of polynoimal under a commutative ring \(R\), The proof of properties is nearly same with the proof of arithemtic properties of intger.

\begin{theorem}[Euclidean Algorithm] $ \\$
    Suppose that \(R\) is a domain and \(f,g \in R[X]\) with \(f\) a monic polynomial, then there exists unique polynoimals \(r,s \in R[X]\) such that
    \[g = sf + r\]
    with \(\deg r < deg f\) or \( \deg r =0\)
     
    \begin{proof}
        \textbf{Existence:}        
         If \( \deg g < \deg f \), simply set \( s = 0 \), \( r = g \). Then \( g = sf + r \) and \( \deg r < \deg f \), as required.  Suppose \( \deg g \geq \deg f \). Let
        \[
        g = a_n X^n + \dots + a_0, \quad f = X^d +...+b_0.
        \]
        Let \( n = \deg g \), \( d = \deg f \). Then define
        \[
        s_1 = a_nX^{n-d}
        \]
        Then the degree of \(r_1 = g -s_1f\) will be less than \(n\), if the degree is still larger than \(d\), we do the same procedure till some integer \(k\):
        \begin{align*}
            r_1 &= g-s_1f \\
            r_2 &= r_1 - s_2f\\
            &...\\
            r_k &= r_{k-1} - s_kf
        \end{align*}
        where \(s_i = a_iX^{m_i}\) with \(a_i\) the leading cofficient of \(r_{i-1}\) and \(m_i = \deg r_{i-1} -d\). \(k\) satisfies
        \[\deg r_1 > \deg r_2 > ... > \deg r_{k-1} \geq d=deg f > \deg r_{k}\]
        Finally, adding them togther we get 
        \[r = r_k, s = s_1+s_2+...+s_k\]
        \textbf{Uniqueness:} Suppose there exist two such decompositions:
        \[
        g = s_1 f + r_1 = s_2 f + r_2.
        \]
        Then:
        \[
        (s_1 - s_2)f = r_2 - r_1.
        \]
        The left-hand side is divisible by \( f \) if \(s_1 \neq s_2\), and the right-hand side has degree strictly less than \( \deg f \), unless it is zero. Since \( R \) is an integral domain, this implies \( r_1 = r_2 \) and thus \( s_1 = s_2 \). Hence the decomposition is unique.
        \end{proof}
\end{theorem}

\begin{remark}
    For a field \(K\), \(K[X]\) will be an excellent object to study (we call it \textbf{\(K\)-algebra}) since it satisfies Euclidean Algorithm, Furthermore it will satisfy all arithemtic properties in \(\z\), in brief, it is a Euclidean ring with degree as its euclidean function
